This means that the service actor needs to live in the same JVM as the connector servlet.\nThis will be changed before the 1.1 final release.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"chunked-responses\">\n<h3>Chunked Responses</h3>\n<p>Alternatively to a single <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">HttpResponse</span></tt> instance the handler can choose to respond to the request sender with the\nfollowing sequence of individual messages:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>One <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">ChunkedResponseStart</span></tt></li>\n<li>Zero or more <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">MessageChunks</span></tt></li>\n<li>One <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">ChunkedMessageEnd</span></tt></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The connector servlet writes the individual response parts into the servlet response <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">OutputStream</span></tt> and flushes it.\nWhether these parts are really rendered &#8220;to the wire&#8221; as chunked message parts depends on the servlet container\nimplementation. The Servlet API has not dedicated support for chunked responses.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"request-timeouts\">\n<h3>Request Timeouts</h3>\n<p>If the service actor does not complete a request within the configured <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">request-timeout</span></tt> period a\n<tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">spray.http.Timedout</span></tt> message is sent to the timeout handler, which can be the service actor itself or\nanother actor (depending on the <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">timeout-handler</span></tt> config setting). The timeout handler then has the chance to\ncomplete the request within the time period configured as <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">timeout-timeout</span></tt>. Only if the timeout handler also misses\nits deadline for completing the request will the connector servlet complete the request itself with a &#8220;hard-coded&#8221;\nerror response (which you can change by overriding the <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">timeoutResponse</span></tt> method of the <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">Servlet30ConnectorServlet</span></tt>).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"send-confirmations\">\n<h3>Send Confirmations</h3>\n<p>If required the connector servlet can reply with a &#8220;send confirmation&#8221; message to every response (part) coming in from\nthe application. You request a send confirmation by modifying a response part with the <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">withAck</span></tt> method\n(see the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../spray-can/common-behavior/#acked-sends\"><em>ACKed Sends</em></a> section of the <em>spray-can</em> documentation for example code).\nConfirmation messages are especially helpful for triggering the sending of the next response part in a response\nstreaming scenario, since with such a design the application will never produce more data than the servlet container can\nhandle.</p>\n<p>Send confirmations are always dispatched to the actor, which sent the respective response (part).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"closed-notifications\">\n<h3>Closed Notifications</h3>\n<p>The Servlet API completely hides the actual management of the HTTP connections from the application. Therefore the\nconnector servlet has no real way of finding out whether a connection was closed or not. However, if the connection\nwas closed unexpectedly for whatever reason a subsequent attempt to write to it usually fails with an <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">IOException</span></tt>.\nIn order to adhere to same message protocol as the <em>spray-can</em> <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../spray-can/http-server/#http-server\"><em>HTTP Server</em></a> the connector servlet therefore\ndispatches any exception, which the servlet container throws when a response (part) is written, back to the application\nwrapped in an <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">Tcp.ErrorClosed</span></tt> message.</p>\n<p>In addition the connector servlet also dispatches <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">Tcp.Closed</span></tt> notification messages after the final part of a\nresponse has been successfully written to the servlet container. This allows the application to use the same execution\nmodel for <em>spray-servlet</em> as it would for the <em>spray-can</em> <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"../spray-can/http-server/#http-server\"><em>HTTP Server</em></a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"http-headers\">\n<h2>HTTP Headers</h2>\n<p>The connector servlet always passes all received headers on to the application. Additionally the values of the\n<tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">Content-Length</span></tt> and <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">Content-Type</span></tt> headers are interpreted by the servlet itself. All other headers are of no\ninterest to it.</p>\n<p>Also, if your <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">HttpResponse</span></tt> instances include a <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">Content-Length</span></tt> or <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">Content-Type</span></tt> header they will be ignored\nand <em>not</em> written through to the servlet container (as the connector servlet sets these response headers itself).</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"first admonition-title\">Note</p>\n<p class=\"last\">The <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">Content-Type</span></tt> header has special status in <em>spray</em> since its value is part of the <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">HttpEntity</span></tt> model\nclass. Even though the header also remains in the <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">headers</span></tt> list of the <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">HttpRequest</span></tt> <em>spray&#8217;s</em> higher layers\n(like <em>spray-routing</em>) only work with the Content-Type value contained in the <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">HttpEntity</span></tt>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"differences-to-spray-can\">\n<h2>Differences to spray-can</h2>\n<dl class=\"docutils\">\n<dt>Chunked Requests</dt>\n<dd>Since the Servlet API does not expose the individual request parts of chunked requests to a servlet there is no way\n<em>spray-servlet</em> can pass them through to the application. The way chunked requests are handled is completely up to\nthe servlet container.</dd>\n<dt>Chunked Responses</dt>\n<dd><em>spray-can</em> renders <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">ChunkedResponseStart</span></tt>, <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">MessageChunks</span></tt> and <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">ChunkedMessageEnd</span></tt> messages directly to\n&#8220;the wire&#8221;. Since the Servlet API operates on a somewhat higher level of abstraction <em>spray-servlet</em> can only write\nthese messages to the servlet container one by one, with <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">flush</span></tt> calls in between. The way the servlet container\ninterprets these calls is up to its implementation.</dd>\n<dt><em>Closed</em> Messages</dt>\n<dd>The Servlet API completely hides the actual management of the HTTP connections from the application. Therefore the\nconnector servlet has no way of finding out whether a connection was closed or not. In order to provide a similar\nmessage protocol as <em>spray-can</em> the connector servlet therefore simply assumes that all connections are closed after\nthe final part of a response has been written, no matter whether the servlet container actually uses persistent\nconnections or not.</dd>\n<dt>Timeout Semantics</dt>\n<dd>When working with chunked responses the semantics of the <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">request-timeout</span></tt> config setting are different.\nIn <em>spray-can</em> it designates the maximum time, in which a response must have been <em>started</em> (i.e. the first chunk\nreceived), while in <em>spray-servlet</em> it defines the time, in which the response must have been <em>completed</em> (i.e. the\nlast chunk received).</dd>\n<dt>HTTP Pipelining &amp; SSL Support</dt>\n<dd>Whether and how HTTP pipelining and SSL/TLS encryption are supported depends on the servlet container
