This module is configured via the implicit\n<tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">ServerSSLEngineProvider</span></tt> member on the <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">Http.Bind</span></tt> command message. An <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">ServerSSLEngineProvider</span></tt> is essentially\na function <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">PipelineContext</span> <span class=\"pre\">\u21d2</span> <span class=\"pre\">Option[SSLEngine]</span></tt>, which determines whether encryption is to be performed and, if so,\nwhich <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine</span></tt> instance is to be used.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to apply some custom configuration to your <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">SSLEngine</span></tt> instances an easy way would be to bring a custom\nengine provider into scope, e.g. like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-scala\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">spray.io.ServerSSLEngineProvider</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">implicit</span> <span class=\"k\">val</span> <span class=\"n\">myEngineProvider</span> <span class=\"k\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">ServerSSLEngineProvider</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">engine</span> <span class=\"k\">=&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">engine</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">setEnabledCipherSuites</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">Array</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA&quot;</span><span class=\"o\">))</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">engine</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">setEnabledProtocols</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">Array</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;SSLv3&quot;</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;TLSv1&quot;</span><span class=\"o\">))</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">engine</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>EngineProvider creation also relies on an implicitly available <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">SSLContextProvider</span></tt>, which is defined like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-scala\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span class=\"k\">trait</span> <span class=\"nc\">SSLContextProvider</span> <span class=\"k\">extends</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">PipelineContext</span> <span class=\"k\">\u21d2</span> <span class=\"nc\">Option</span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">SSLContext</span><span class=\"o\">])</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>The default <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">SSLContextProvider</span></tt> simply provides an implicitly available &#8220;constant&#8221; <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">SSLContext</span></tt>, by default the\n<tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"pre\">SSLContext.getDefault</span></tt> is used.
