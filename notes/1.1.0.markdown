Starting with this release _spray-json_ artifacts live on <http://repo.spray.cc/>
and will have group id `cc.spray` rather than `cc.spray.json` as before.

Changes since the last release (1.0.1):

- Added automatic case class field name extraction via new `jsonFormatX` overloads
- Added `asJson` pimp to Strings
- Added `RootJsonFormat` (`JsonFormat` for types corresponding to JSON document roots)
- Fixed problem of JSON object deserialization not being member-order independent
  (removed `JsField`, turned `JsObject(List[JsField])` into `JsObject(Map[String, JsValue])`)
- Fixed issue #8 (Allow (de)serialization of `NaN` (Double)), thx to @stefritz
- Fixed #6 (rename `JsValue:fromJson` to `convertTo`, add `.prettyPrint` and `.compactPrint`)
- Improved deserialization error messages
- Upgraded to SBT 0.11.2
