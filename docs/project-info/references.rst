`VMware <http://www.vmware.com>`_
  Thanks again for all your hard work on spray. The vCloud Integration Manager wouldn't have shipped (at least on time)
  without it, and we look forward to continuing to use it in our current project as well. :-)

`Ebay <http://www.ebay.com>`_
  We are using spray for an internal project here at ebay. It is quite small, and it was mostly as an excuse to learn
  about actor-based programming, but so far we have been very impressed by *spray's* performance and simplicity and the
  fantastic support on the user group.

`Pongr <http://pongr.com>`_
  At Pongr, spray powers the restful API used by our iPhone & Android apps and has been in production for a few months
  now. We use *spray-routing* on top of *spray-can*, wrapped into one fat jar. We are very happy with *spray*.

`yardi.com <http://www.yardi.com>`_
  We're using *spray* for a sizeable set of REST web services for our real-estate platform. Some of the services are a
  REST-based event bus, a notification/email system, a rights-management system (kind of like an authority/security
  system), and many others. We're getting excellent use out of *spray*, and want to pass on our thanks again for all
  the work!

`Metafor Software <http://metaforsoftware.com/>`_
  We just went live with *spray* in production for the REST backend of our "single-page" web app a couple weeks ago.
  Very low volume, since we're still in semi-private beta, but I'm very happy with it so far.
  The immutable request/response model is a huge win for clarity and composability.

`telfish.com <http://www.telfish.com>`_
  We are using *spray-can*, *spray-server* and *spray-json* for our customer-facing query API for more than a year now
  and are very happy with it. Our API code is robust, fast and easy to maintain.

`Zuberance <http://www.zuberance.com>`_
  We developed a new product completely on top of Scala/Akka/spray and are just finishing up beta.

`system insights <http://systeminsights.com>`_
  We converted from Jersey, which took about 2 weeks. The testability of *spray* is great -- and runs fast.
